            Hi Everyone, I am <span>Muhammad</span> <strong>Bilal</strong> from
            Punjab, <span>Pakistan</span>.I am a professional and enthusiastic
            programmer in my daily life. I am a quick learner with a
            self-learning attitude. I love to learn and explore new technologies
            and am passionate about problem-solving. I love almost all the
            stacks of web application development and love to make the web more
            open to the world. My core skill is based on JavaScript and I love
            to do most of the things using JavaScript. I am available for any
            kind of job opportunity that suits my skills and interests.
